## Problem Statement

One of the critical value propositions of AppBuilder is the ability to customize
`App`s to meet the look and feel of the customers organization. For example, I
might want to include the PwC logo on the top of my tax calculator or the Ford
logo on the top of my car purchase configurator. As of right now, the only way a
user can add a image to their `App` is to drag in an image component and then
copy and paste a URL. This requires the image to be hosted somewhere on the
internet, be publicly accessible and be in the format that the user wants. A
Creator should be able to upload any static asset (image, video etc) and use
that on their `App`.

## Assumptions

* A Creator wants to be able to upload a static asset and deliver that through
  their AppBuilder `App`
* A Consumer wants to be able to view that static asset on any number of
  different devices / device types (web, mobile, tablet)
* A Creator wants to be able to reuse static assets across multiple `App`s
