Currently,\nwe even bake this into out planning; we carve out 20% of our time for paying\ndown tech debt and I often wonder if this is enough.

I’m calling it **career debt**.\n\nCareer debt is what builds up when engineers go too long without doing\nsomething that excites them, challenges them or helps them grow. It’s what\nhappens when work is always safe, repetitive, or product-first with no room for\nexploration or personal development.\n\nJust like technical debt, career debt isn’t immediately catastrophic. In fact,\non paper, everything might look great: features shipped, bugs squashed,\ndeadlines met. But underneath the surface your top engineers are starting to\nfeel stuck. Bored. Maybe even resentful. Eventually, that shows up in ways\nyou can’t ignore: disengagement, low morale, slower iteration and attrition.\n\nI had a recent example of this on my team. We needed to build a temporary event\nqueue to solve a specific business problem. The simplest, most pragmatic answer\nwas to use a Redis based solution — something we’ve used before, something the\nteam is fluent in and something that would’ve gotten us a working solution the\nfastest.\n\nBut two of our strongest engineers had a different idea. They’d been wanting to\nlearn Kafka, and they saw this as a chance to dig in and build something real\nwith it.\n\nNow, let’s be honest: Kafka is not the ideal tool for a simple event queue.\nIt’s complex. It’s operationally heavier. And it likely wasn’t the “right”\ntechnical decision for the problem at hand. But here’s the thing — it wasn’t a\nhigh-stakes, time-sensitive project. We had some breathing room. And more\nimportantly, this was a chance to invest in those engineers.\n\nSo I let them run with it. Build a Proof of Concept. Explore Kafka. Make the\ncase, do the integration, and see where it led.\n\nWas it slower than going with Redis? Yeah. Did they eventually realize that\nKafka wasn’t the right fit for our use case? Absolutely. But the process? It was\nworth every minute. They learned something new. They led the conversation. They\ncame to their own conclusion. And they felt trusted and empowered along the\nway.\n\nThat’s what paying down career debt looks like.\n\nIt’s not about throwing out the roadmap or turning every sprint into a\nhackathon. It’s about recognizing that if you only ever prioritize the\nimmediate product outcome, you risk slowly draining the long-term health of\nyour team.\n\nSo how do you manage career debt? You make space. Space for exploration. Space\nfor growth. Space for engineers to do something for no other reason than that\nthey’re curious or excited about it. That might look like:\n\n* Spikes or POCs for non-roadmap technologies\n\n* “Engineer’s choice” weeks where people pick their own projects\n\n* Rotations across teams or tech stacks\n\n* Internal talks, mentorship, or time to write and share what they’ve learned\n\nThe best teams I’ve seen don’t just manage technical debt, they manage\nmotivation and engagement.

Not just played it—I\n*earned* it. But the story starts a little before that.\n\n## The Bachelor Party That Went North (Literally)\n\nFor my bachelor party, a group of friends and I flew to Scotland. Only two of us\nactually golf, but we sprinkled in just enough golf to keep things\ninteresting—alongside the real stars of the trip: sightseeing, scotch, and\ngeneral shenanigans.\n\nJay and I kicked things off by playing North Berwick on the first day. It’s\nstill my favorite golf course in the world.

We somehow found a cricket batting\ncage (note: not our sport), sampled our way through a few whisky bars, and ate\nat a Brazilian steakhouse because, why not?\n\n## The Midnight Pilgrimage to St. Andrews\n\nAt 10:30pm, Jay and I packed up and hit the road, leaving the cobbled streets of\nEdinburgh for the home of golf. It’s about a 90-minute drive to St. Andrews, and\nwe arrived just after midnight. We parked by The Old Course Hotel and walked up\nthe 18th fairway in the dark.\n\nWe were heading for the Old Pavilion to get in the singles queue—a historic and\nslightly masochistic process that, until recently, was your best chance of\ngetting onto the Old Course without a tee time.\n\n### How the Singles Queue Worked (RIP)\n\nIn the past, golfers could line up outside the Old Pavilion during the night and hope to snag a tee time the next morning due to cancellations or no-shows. You didn’t need a reservation—just patience, persistence, and the willingness to sleep on concrete.\n\nJay and I were the 16th and 17th people in line. We had no chairs. We barely sat. But the crowd around us was lively. The guys in front of us were a group of friendly Canadians on a week-long golf binge, and we passed around a bottle of Kingsbarns whisky as the night went on.\n\nBy the time the sun started rising around 4:30am, we’d been awake for 24 hours.\n\n## Hope, Heartbreak, and a Really Good Sausage Roll\n\nEventually, the staff opened the doors and started assigning tee times. We watched hopefully as the line crept forward… and then stopped. All the tee times were gone by the time they got to us.\n\nWe were told to come back at 9am in case of cancellations, but also warned there wasn’t a high likelihood we’d be able to play *together*. That stung.\n\nTrying to stay positive, we wandered into town and grabbed breakfast at **Munch**, where I had a genuinely incredible sausage roll. Highly recommend if you’re in St. Andrews.\n\nWe came back at 9. No luck. They told us to come back *again* at 4:30pm for possible late-afternoon rounds. That might sound crazy late, but in Scotland on June 1st, the sun doesn’t set until close to 10pm.\n\n## Making the Most of It\n\nDejected but determined, Jay and I took our clubs to the **New Course**—a misnomer if there ever was one. It was built in 1895, and while it’s not the Old, it’s still a fantastic test of golf.\n\n> No carts, of course. And still no sleep.\n\nI laid down on the tee box—*twice*—between shots, trying to grab a minute of rest. It was worth it. The New Course has some incredible approach shots and a classic links layout that’s absolutely worth playing if you’re in town.\n\n## The Old Course, At Last\n\nWe finished our round, limped back to the Pavilion, and waited.\n\nThere was a tee time for a single. Then another. Jay and I passed, wanting to hold out for a chance to play together. Eventually, we were told that a 6:30pm slot had opened—but the other two players were R&A members, and they declined to let anyone else join.\n\nWe stood just off to the right of the first tee, devastated. This was *it*—the whole reason we came. It’d been nearly 18 hours since we got in line.\n\nThen the starter walked up to us.\n\n> “The 6:30 didn’t show. It’s yours if you want it. You probably won’t get all 18 in, but you’re welcome to try.”\n\nWe were on that tee in seconds.\n\nJay striped an iron. I topped a 5-wood that somehow stayed on the fairway. But\nwe were playing. *Together*. At the Old Course. With no one else around.\n\n![First tee](../../assets/old-course/1-tee.jpg)\n\n## The Final Stretch\n\nMy brother had taken the train up and ended up playing the Jubilee Course. At some point around the 11th tee, we saw a lone figure walking toward us—it was him, come to walk the final stretch with us.\n\nBy the 15th tee, we were starving. It’d been almost 24 hours since we’d eaten. Our friends had made it to town and were at the Rusacks Hotel. We begged for food. They eventually walked out to meet us with cold burgers and sweet potato fries on the 15th fairway.\n\nBest meal of my life.\n\nThe sun started to dip low on 17—the famous **Road Hole**—and we used phone flashlights to find our tee shots. By 18, it was pitch black. We lit up the tee box with our phones and hit our final shots into the night.\n\n![The Road Hole](../../assets/old-course/17-tee.jpg)\n\nJay stuck one. I ended up in the Valley of Sin.\n\nWe both made our putts.\n\n## Exhausted, Exhilarated, Grateful\n\n![Finished](../../assets/old-course/finished.jpg)\n\nWe hugged on the 18th green—hungry, dehydrated, sleepless, euphoric.\n\nWe’d done it.\n\nWe played the Old Course together. I’ll never forget a single moment of it, and I wouldn’t change a single thing.
