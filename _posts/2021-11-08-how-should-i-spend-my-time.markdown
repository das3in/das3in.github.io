For my entire life I've had a team to compete with. In Elementary and Middle
School, I played youth football, soccer and was in the orchestra. In High School
I played football, swam, was on the debate team and started playing paintball
competitively. As I got older I played Magic the Gathering with a couple core
groups of people and continued playing paintball at the highest levels. I say
this all because, for the first time in my life, I don't have a competitive
group right now and coincidentally, I also don't know what to do with my time.

I have plenty of interests: video games are kinda fun, I like making/building
things, writing code is cool and I'm a huge film nerd. The difference is that
none of those are either a) competitive (especially at this stage of my life) or
b) group activities. For a long time I'd considered myself an introvert but I'm
discovering more and more that my energy and motivation comes from other people.
Sure, I could start filming stuff and learn to edit. I could build a pair of
jeans or sew a shirt. I could continue roasting coffee. But the isolating nature
of those things seems so demotivating.

As I'm writing the answer seems obvious: choose the one that I can share with my
friends. There are plenty of DIY communities out there, and filmmaking
communities. Discord / the internet in general has brought people closer
together too. Also, maybe I'm past the point in my life where I need to be
`competitive.` Maybe I can pick something and compete with myself; let
improvement be a good enough goal.
