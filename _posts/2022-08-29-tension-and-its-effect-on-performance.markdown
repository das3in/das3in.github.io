### golf is a fun game

I picked up golf during the begining months of the
COVID-19 pandemic. I've always had a sport that I could use to channel my
competitiveness and golf took that spot when it was realistically the only thing
to during covid. I took a (socially-distanced of course) lesson in the first
couple weeks of June 2020 and since then have taught myself through a mix of
watching the pros, reading and some instructional YouTube channels.

After two years of teaching myself, I became a reasonably competent golfer. I
can get around a golf course without losing a lot of balls. I'll have a mishit
occasionally but generally can hit the ball close to the direction I want and
close to the general distance I want. Still, I'm plagued with inconsistency. I
can be having a perfectly good day and then, seemingly without reason, shank a
couple shots into the woods.

Golf uses a handicap system to measure progress and create equity amongst
players with disparate skill levels. In order to start playing in amateur
tournaments, you typically need a handicap index of around 4. Mine is
currently 14. I made a lot of progress, but I decided it was time to get another
lesson to set me on the right course to get to the next level. That lesson
turned into a therapy session, where I learned as much about myself as I did my
golf game.
